<!-- The page structure, which was decided upon by our client Rob, allows for either a
3 by 2 layout in the desktop, giving the reader an easy viewing to all the website's
content, or by the mobile layout, which is a 1 by 6 scrollable column with each div
divided equally among the website and the ability to see the images easily. Also,
on the mobile layout, the text in the text-specific divs will be able to scroll
in order to avoid potential overflowing. -->

					<p>The starting players’ jersey numbers for Game 7 were:
4, 8, 34, 45, and 41.
They paved the way for the game’s eventual victory for the Lakers.</p>

					<p>As seen here, we have the defining “Kobe-Shaq Alley Oop” that practically ended the game. One thing’s for sure, it’s better than anything the Houston Rockets could do at the time!</p>

<!-- As a special request to our layout by our client Rob, we implemented a bar at
the bottom of the screen that held links to the NBA and biographies about Kobe Bryant
and Shaquille O'Neal. -->
